With a strong foundation in Business Analytics, I hold a Master's degree from Macquarie University, where I specialized in data modelling, statistical analysis, and machine learning techniques applicable to big data. Though new to the industry, my academic journey has been rich with practical experiences, including extensive projects that I've meticulously documented on this GitHub profile. These projects demonstrate my ability to harness data for insightful business solutions, a skill I'm eager to apply in a professional data analyst role. My education not only equipped me with technical proficiency but also with an ethical approach to data handling and an ability to effectively collaborate in diverse teams. I am passionately transitioning into the field of data analysis, ready to bring my academic learnings to tackle real-world challenges.
