Hi there, I'm Vivian - **a data enthusiast** with a strong foundation in the retail industry and stakeholder engagement.

Coming from a business background, I know how challenging it can be to step into data — but it’s exactly that challenge that excites me. I enjoy turning raw numbers into clear insights, building dashboards that tell stories, and uncovering patterns that support smarter decisions.

This GitHub is where I share my projects and learnings as I grow in the world of data. 

🚀 Thanks for stopping by — feel free to explore, connect, or just say hi!
